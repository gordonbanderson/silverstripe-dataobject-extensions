	* Adds first/last/start/end class to a list item.
	*
	* Sometimes you need to:
	* Lay out a load of thumbnails in a grid.
	* Style only the first or last elements in a vertical/horizontal list of items
	*
	* You can do this using nth-child pseudoselectors, but it is dangerous.
	*
	* Instead, on any list of elements:
	*
	* - add a _first_ class to the very first one
	* - add a _last_ class to the very last one
	* - add a _start_ class to the first item on a row (e.g. every 4th item, starting with the first one)
	* - add an _end_ class to the last item on a row (e.g. every 4th item, starting with the fourth one)
	*
	* @param $rowLength length of each row
	* @return string list class
